We are pleased to present the first in a series of public beta
releases of The List.

The work you are about to see is still in active development, but we have worked hard over the last few months to put an app together that we think you'll enjoy using.

## What you'll need

**One of the following**

* An Android phone or tablet (we've had some success with Android 2.3 but 4.x and 5.0 have been tested more)
* A mobile or desktop web browser (iPhone and iPad users, this is what you'll use)

**You will also need**

* A Creative Commons account. You can get one of these from <http://login.creativecommons.org> -- it takes only a few seconds, but you will need to confirm your email address.
* To agree to our [terms and conditions for using the app](https://thelist.creativecommons.org/app/alpha-tos.html) in this early stage.
* An understanding that **any images you upload will be deleted** at various stages during our early public testing.
* To give us your feedback. Bugs, problems, suggestions and more are welcome at our GitHub issue tracker.
* For this you will need a GitHub account. If you don't want to make a GitHub account, you can submit bugs to the [cc-devel mailing list](http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel).

**You can help make The List better**

* We are looking for PHP and Java developers to help with the development work of The List.
* We are looking for designers who want to help us make The List app in its various guises more attractive and improve the user experience.
* We are looking for documenters to help write good user and developer guides to The List.
  * We have [one developers guide already](https://thelist.creativecommons.org/hacking/webapp/).
* We're looking for people to help build and package The List app in various app stores and marketplaces.
* Want to port The List to iOS? FirefoxOS? Meego? Windows Phone? Palm? Get in touch.

**Spread the word**

* Tell your friends and family on social media using the hashtag **#TheListCC**.
* Write about us, blog about us, talk to us.

**We are committed to working in the open, in public wikis and issue trackers and in ways that include all users.**

If you're interested in working with us, let us know via our issue tracker.
