We are pleased to present the first in a series of public beta
releases of The List.

The work you are about to see is still in active development, but we
have worked hard over the last few months to put an app together that
we think you'll enjoy using.

## What you'll need

* An Android phone or tablet (we've had some success with Android 2.3 but 4.x and 5.0 have been tested more)
* A Creative Commons account. You can get one of these from <http://login.creativecommons.org> -- it takes only a few seconds, but you will need to confirm your email address.
* To agree to our [terms and conditions for using the app](https://github.com/creativecommons/list/blob/master/docs/beta-TOS.md).

With all that in mind, please [proceed to the download page](/downloads/).
