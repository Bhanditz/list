<p class="lead">No one can be everywhere at once. But <em>everyone</em> can.</p>

<p class="lead">NGOs, journalists, government agencies, and cultural institutions all need photographs to tell their story and educate others. But there's no way for those organizations to be in the right place at the right time, every time. That's where we come in.</p>

Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations, people, and events that they need photographs of. And when users are in the right place at the right time, they can claim an item from the list and publish a photograph of it.</p>

<p>All of the photographs captured through The List will be licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution license</a>. That means that anyone will be able to reuse them for any purpose, commercial or noncommercial, as long as they give the photographer credit. We're building a collection of high-quality photography that anyone can use, with no fees or hoops to jump through.</p>

<p>Whether it's a lighthouse, a lunar eclipse, or a political demonstration, you can be the person to take the perfect shot.</p>

<p>The List is still in development. If you're a developer, <a href="/get-involved/">we'd love your help!</a> If your organization would like to sign up as a listmaker, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/contact">drop us a line</a>.

<p>The List is a project of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, supported by a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/44004">generous grant from the Knight Foundation</a>.</p>
