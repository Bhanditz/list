<p class="lead">No one can be everywhere at once. But <em>everyone</em> can.</p>

<p class="lead">NGOs, journalists, government agencies, and cultural institutions all need photographs to tell their story and educate others. But there's no way for those organizations to be in the right place at the right time, every time. That's where we come in.</p>

Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations, people, and events that they need photographs of. And when users are in the right place at the right time, they can claim an item from the list and publish a photograph of it.</p>
