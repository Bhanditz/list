**We have released version 0.8 of the Android version of The List powered by Creative Commons.**

We've skipped ahead a bit, and this is version 0.8.

We have a photo gallery! Now you can see your hard work.

Thanks to everyone who has already been testing The List, and sorry if
you had a bunch of instant crashes with the app. We figured these out,
and they're fixed now.

Thanks for this release to Dan Marti (@mvdan) who helped us fix up
some of the build scripts.

We'll be doing our first public demo in a few weeks in Miami. We'd love to ask you some questions about The List powered by Creative Commons! [Please complete our survey](http://goo.gl/YN5C5P).
