**We have released version 0.4 of the Android version of The List.**

New features in this version include the addition of the ACRA Crash
Reporter, better support for categories and stability fixes. Also
included is the ability to opt-out of Google Analytics.

We are currently working towards version 0.5, which will include
some initial photo gallery functionality.

We are looking to interview some users of the mobile app about their
usage. If you're interested in helping us out, please get in touch
with us via email -- <info@creativecommons.org>.
