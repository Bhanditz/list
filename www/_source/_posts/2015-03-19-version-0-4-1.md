**We have released version 0.4.1 of the Android version of The List powered by Creative Commons.**

This is a bug fix release that replaces version 0.4.0 released earlier
this week. Some users have reported a crash that occurs when opening
the app. This release fixes that problem.

If you continue to have problems, please uninstall the app from your
phone (usually the app can be found in 'Applications' under your
phone's settings, an uninstall option is provided).

We are currently working towards version 0.5, which will include
some initial photo gallery functionality.

We are looking to interview some users of the mobile app about their
usage. If you're interested in helping us out, please get in touch
with us via email -- <info@creativecommons.org>.
