* Title -- Matt Lee, CC, The List

* "No one can be everywhere at once. But everyone can. NGOs, journalists, government agencies, and cultural institutions all need photographs to tell their story and educate others. But there’s no way for those organizations to be in the right place at the right time, every time. That’s where we come in."

* Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations, people, and events that they need photographs of. And when users are in the right place at the right time, they can claim an item from the list and publish a photograph of it. All photos on The List are openly licensed, meaning that everyone can use them."

* The goal of our project is to grow the public commons. As Creative Commons, we are uniquely positioned to foster the creation of this app, and also to promote its usage. 95% of users in our test group said that they installed our app to help support the public commons. 

* Why do users value attribution and contributing to the greater good? Recognition is one, but most users just want the commons to grow, and see our app as a way of doing that. If they could see their images being used by other people, most people say they'd use our app regularly to build the commons.
