## 1. Your Agreement to the Terms

These terms of use apply to your use of The List Powered by Creative Commons, whether used via the web or the mobile application (“The List Service”). These terms of use form a binding legal agreement between you and Creative Commons in relation to your use of The List Service. This legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms.”

If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use The List Service.  

## 2. Description of The List Service 1.0

The List Service contains lists of items to be photographed. Users with a CCID account may upload original photos of items on those lists. The photos are licensed under a CC BY 4.0 license, saved on CC’s servers, and may be uploaded to the Internet Archive to be accessed by the general public. The code base for The List Service is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v.3 or later, and all content on The List Service that is owned by Creative Commons is available under CC BY 4.0. 

You understand and agree that the current version of The List Service is a beta version, which is still in development. The List Service is likely to change in design and functionality, and it may contain errors.

## 3. Final product release

Upon the final product release of The List Service, you will be required to accept new terms of service in order to continue using The List Service. 

## 4. Content Supplied by You

You represent, warrant, and agree that no content uploaded or otherwise shared by you on or through The List Service violates or infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or proprietary rights, breaches or conflicts with any obligation, such as a confidentiality obligation, or contains libelous, defamatory, or otherwise unlawful material.

* Photos: Except for images you share from third party applications for the limited purposes described in Section 5 below, you may only share photos on The List Service if you are the sole copyright holder. When you contribute an image to The List Service in response to a requested List item, you retain your copyright upon upload, and you agree that the photo is hereby licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (“CC BY”) and may be used under the terms of that license or any later version of a Creative Commons Attribution License. You further agree that Creative Commons has the right to upload your photos to the Internet Archive and to retain the files on CC’s servers and otherwise use the photos under the terms of the Creative Commons license. 

* Other content: Except for photos, you agree that all text and other content you provide to The List Service is hereby dedicated to the public domain via the CC0 public domain dedication (“CC0”) or is otherwise in the public domain if not original to you. 

* Attribution: You agree that you will be attributed for your photos with your personal name or pseudonym on CCID at the time of upload and that this satisfies the requirement in the CC BY license that the creator be identified. You may change the name on your CCID at any time, but you understand and agree that doing so will not change the way you are attributed for photos you uploaded previously.  

* Removal: Creative Commons may, but is not obligated to, review any content you upload (including photos) and may delete or remove it (without notice) in its sole discretion. Removal of any of your content from The List Service (by you or Creative Commons) does not impact any rights you granted in your content under the terms of a CC BY license or CC0. 

## 5. Interaction with Third Party Applications.

You can share your own images from The List Service via many of the third party applications installed on your phone or tablet. As these images are your own work, you do not need to provide attribution to yourself. Future releases of The List Service will let you share the work of other users of The List (if you’re reading this and have a good idea for a catchy way to refer to The List users, send us a pull request to this document on GitHub).

You can also share images from these applications into The List Service, solely in connection with your suggestions for possible list items to be photographed by other users of The List Service. These images may be shared with other users of the The List Service. You are responsible for ensuring you have permission to share images on The List Service for this purpose.
