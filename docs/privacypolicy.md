This Privacy Policy explains when and how Creative Commons collects, uses, and shares your information when you use The List Powered by Creative Commons, whether used via the web or mobile application (“The List Service”). 

### What information we collect

Creative Commons uses Google Analytics to collect browsing and usage data in order to help us understand and improve the use of The List Service. When you install The List Service, you have the option to opt out of Google Analytics if you prefer that we not collect this data from you thereafter. The List Service is free software, licensed under the GNU Affero General Public license version 3.0 (or at your option, any later version), and you may freely build versions of the application which do not contain this feature.

Before you contribute images to The List Service, you will be required to get a Creative Commons ID (“CCID”) from login.creativecommons.org. To register for a CCID account, you will need to provide certain personal information to Creative Commons, including a name or pseudonym, username, and password. Creative Commons’ usage of the information you provide to create a CCID account is governed by the [Creative Commons Master Privacy Policy](http://creativecommons.org/privacy), but your CCID name or pseudonym and email address will also be collected by Creative Commons when you use The List Service.  

When you contribute images to The List Service, you are sharing them with the public for reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) License as explained in the [Terms of Use](https://github.com/creativecommons/list/blob/master/docs/beta-TOS.md). Your name or pseudonym on CCID at the time you upload the photo to The List Service will be publicly shared in connection with your images. 

### What we do with your information

We may share the images you contributed to The List Service (along with your personal name or pseudonym) to the Internet Archive and may otherwise use your images under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

### Interacting with third party applications and services

Sharing from the application: You can share your own images from The List Service via many of the third party applications installed on your phone or tablet. 

Sharing into the application: You can also share images from these applications into The List Service, in connection with your suggestions for possible list items to be photographed by other users of The List Service. These images may be shared with other users of the The List Service.

In either case, your use of those third party applications is subject to the terms and conditions of those service providers, including their privacy policies.

### Changes to this policy

We will update this policy as we add new features to The List Service. When we do so, we will indicate the effective date. Your continued use of The List Service constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy. 

Effective: June 2, 2015
