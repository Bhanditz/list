The List powered by Creative Commons
====================================

No one can be everywhere at once. But *everyone* can.

NGOs, journalists, government agencies, and cultural institutions all
need photographs to tell their story and educate others. But there's
no way for those organizations to be in the right place at the right
time, every time. That's where we come in.

Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations,
people, and events that they need photographs of. And when users are
in the right place at the right time, they can claim an item from the
list and publish a photograph of it.
