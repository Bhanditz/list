The first time you run this command the database will be initialized, allow
several seconds for this to happen before trying to connect.

The web server IP will be output to the logs in a line containing the string:

    AH00558

Copy this IP and connect to it in a web browser.

About The Setup
---------------

We use a data container, a database server container and a web server container.

The database server container uses a customised version of the MariaDB Docker
image startup script that runs an sql command file during image creation.

The web server container uses a Debian image with Apache and php5 installed.
The Dockerfile creates a config.php file set up to match the database server
and web server image details, and modifies the Apache config file to rewrite
urls as specified in webapp/README.
